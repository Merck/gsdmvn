\arguments{
\item{theta}{natural parameter for group sequential design representing expected incremental drift at all analyses;
used for power calculation}

\item{theta1}{natural parameter used for lower bound spending; if \code{NULL}, this will be set to \code{theta}
which yields the usual beta-spending. If set to 0, spending is 2-sided under null hypothesis.}

\item{info}{proportionate statistical information at all analyses for input \code{theta}}

\item{info0}{proportionate statistical information under null hypothesis, if different than alternative;
impacts null hypothesis bound calculation}

\item{info1}{proportionate statistical information under alternate hypothesis;
impacts null hypothesis bound calculation}

\item{alpha}{One-sided Type I error}

\item{beta}{Type II error}

\item{binding}{indicator of whether futility bound is binding; default of FALSE is recommended}

\item{upper}{function to compute upper bound}

\item{lower}{function to compare lower bound}

\item{upar}{parameter to pass to function provided in \code{upper}}

\item{lpar}{Parameter passed to function provided in \code{lower}}

\item{test_upper}{indicator of which analyses should include an upper (efficacy) bound; single value of TRUE (default) indicates all analyses;
otherwise, a logical vector of the same length as \code{info} should indicate which analyses will have an efficacy bound}

\item{test_lower}{indicator of which analyses should include an lower bound; single value of TRUE (default) indicates all analyses;
single value FALSE indicated no lower bound; otherwise, a logical vector of the same length as \code{info} should indicate which analyses will have a
lower bound}

\item{r}{Integer, at least 2; default of 18 recommended by Jennison and Turnbull}

\item{tol}{Tolerance parameter for boundary convergence (on Z-scale)}

\description{
\code{gs_design_npe()} derives group sequential design size, bounds and boundary crossing probabilities based on proportionate
information and effect size at analyses.
It allows a non-constant treatment effect over time, but also can be applied for the usual homogeneous effect size designs.
It requires treatment effect and proportionate statistical information at each analysis as well as a method of deriving bounds, such as spending.
The routine enables two things not available in the gsDesign package: 1) non-constant effect, 2) more flexibility in boundary selection.
For many applications, the non-proportional-hazards design function \code{gs_design_nph()} will be used; it calls this function.
Initial bound types supported are 1) spending bounds, 2) fixed bounds, and 3) Haybittle-Peto-like bounds.
The requirement is to have a boundary update method that can each bound without knowledge of future bounds.
As an example, bounds based on conditional power that require knowledge of all future bounds are not supported by this routine;
a more limited conditional power method will be demonstrated.
Boundary family designs Wang-Tsiatis designs including the original (non-spending-function-based) O'Brien-Fleming and Pocock designs
are not supported by \code{gs_power_npe()}.
}
\details{
The inputs \code{info} and \code{info0} should be vectors of the same length with increasing positive numbers.
The design returned will change these by some constant scale factor to ensure the design has power \code{1 - beta}.
The bound specifications in \code{upper, lower, upar, lpar} will be used to ensure Type I error and other boundary properties are as specified.

\arguments{
\item{p_c}{rate at the control group}

\item{p_e}{rate at the experimental group}

\item{rd0}{treatment effect under super-superiority designs, the default is 0}

\item{alpha}{One-sided Type I error}

\item{beta}{Type II error}

\item{ratio}{Experimental:Control randomization ratio (not yet implemented)}

\item{ratio_stratum}{randomization ratio of different stratum.
If it is un-stratified design then \code{NULL}.
Otherwise it is a tibble contraining two columns (Stratum and Ratio).}

\item{weight}{the weighting scheme for stratified population}

\item{upper}{Function to compute upper bound}

\item{lower}{Function to compute lower bound}

\item{upar}{Parameter passed to \code{upper()}}

\item{lpar}{Parameter passed to \code{lower()}}

\item{test_upper}{indicator of which analyses should include an upper (efficacy) bound; single value of TRUE (default) indicates all analyses;
otherwise, a logical vector of the same length as \code{info} should indicate which analyses will have an efficacy bound}

\item{test_lower}{indicator of which analyses should include an lower bound; single value of TRUE (default) indicates all analyses;
single value FALSE indicated no lower bound; otherwise, a logical vector of the same length as \code{info} should indicate which analyses will have a
lower bound}

\item{info_scale}{}

\item{binding}{indicator of whether futility bound is binding; default of FALSE is recommended}

\item{r}{Integer, at least 2; default of 18 recommended by Jennison and Turnbull}

\item{tol}{Tolerance parameter for boundary convergence (on Z-scale)}

\item{n}{sample size}
